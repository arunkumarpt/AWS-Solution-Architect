Comparison
  - cost, pas as you go,elastic computing (add server on need basis and remove after use - automatic), scalable, sucrity complaince are offered(PCI,HIPAA).

Vertical vs horizontal scaling

horizontal scaling (Load Balancer, more instances)

Core AWS services

EC2, Simpe storage Service, s3 is slow due to multiple locations. EC2 loads the image to epheremeal storage. s3 to physical storage. volitility :(

Elastic Block Store - faster, not volatile. s3 is stable to store images

3 options 

1. s3
2. s3 to epheremel (free).
3. EBS faster, not lost, (pay money)


Cloudwatch - for monitoring
